							<b>1. WESTERN UNION ("WU") MONEY TRANSFER® SERVICES VIGO ("VIGO") MONEY TRANSFER SERVICES AND ORLANDI VALUTA ("ORLANDI VALUTA") MONEY TRANSFER SERVICES ("SERVICES") ARE PROVIDED BY WESTERN UNION FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. ("WESTERN UNION") AND ARE SUBJECT TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ("AGREEMENT") AND APPLICABLE LAW.</b> Additional information regarding the Services may be obtained at <a href="www.westernunion.com">www.westernunion.com</a>, www.vigousa.com and www.orlandivaluta.com, depending on the services you choose. Service and funds availability depends on certain factors including the Service selected, the selection of delayed delivery options, amount sent, destination country, currency availability, regulatory issues, consumer protection issues, identification requirements, delivery restrictions, agent location hours, and differences in time zones (collectively, "Restrictions"). The designated recipient ("Receiver") may generally receive funds sent by Western Union consumer ("You") at Agent locations in the Expected Payout Location. For transactions sent within the U.S., the Expected Payout Location generally means any Agent location in the destination state or U.S. territory You identify. For transactions sent outside the U.S., Expected Payout Location generally means any Agent location in the destination country You identify. The Services offered by Telecomunicaciones de Mexico ("Telecomm") are only available at Telecomm locations. You may pay for the Services by using a U.S. issued Visa or MasterCard credit card, or debit card issued by or through a financial institution located in the U.S. ("Bank Card"). Alternatively, you may pay with cash at a Western Union agent location or using Western Union's mobile phone, WUPay or ACH options ("Alternative Payment Options"). The total due is payable before Western Union processes the transaction. If Western Union does not receive authorization from the Bank Card issuer (or your account provider, in the case of Alternative Payment Options), the transaction will not be processed and funds will not be transmitted to the Receiver. Each time You use your Bank Card or Alternative Payment Options to pay for Services, You agree that Western Union is authorized to charge Your designated Bank Card or applicable account for the total disclosed to You relating to the transaction. Receiver will normally receive funds sent by You in cash, check, or a combination thereof; with some Services, funds may be credited to a bank, prepaid or credit card, mobile wallet, or similar account. Receiver may be able to elect a payout method that differs from the payout method You specify; You authorize Western Union to honor Receiver's election of payout method. Receivers who choose to receive funds through a payout method other than cash or in a currency other than the one You selected may incur additional fees to access funds. Certain countries and/or jurisdictions may impose a tax, fee and/or tariff on Your transaction and/ or Receiver's receipt of, or access to, transferred funds. Transactions: (i) which exceed certain amounts; (ii) to certain destinations; (iii) that implicate certain regulatory issues or consumer protection issues; or (iv) sent through delayed options may take longer, be subject to dollar limits or be subject to additional Restrictions. Transactions may be reported to applicable authorities. Messaging and notification services may incur additional fees. In some destinations Receiver may be required to provide identification, a test question answer or both to receive funds in cash. Test questions are not an additional security feature and cannot be used to time or delay the payment of a transaction and are prohibited in certain countries. Western Union relies on the information you provide us to send money. Please review all transaction details for accuracy before completing your transaction.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>2. ADMINISTRATION CHARGE:</b> Transactions not picked up or canceled by You within one year of the send date will be assessed a non-refundable administration charge of up to fifty cents per month from the send date, not to exceed forty-two dollars, which will be deducted from the amount sent (or where such charge exceeds the maximum amount permitted by law, the maximum amount permitted by law).

							<b>3. REFUNDS: Subject to applicable law: (i) transfers may be canceled for a refund of the principal amount, unless the funds have been picked up or deposited at the time Western Union receives Your written request; (ii) for certain services, excluding Western Union's bill payment and prepaid products and services, Western Union may provide a transfer fee refund if funds are not available within the specified timeframe; and (iii) Western Union may charge You a fee to refund the principal amount back to You in those instances where Receiver rejects Your funds. Qualifying refunds for transfers that begin and end in the United States will be made within 45 days of receipt of Your valid written request. Western Union may issue Your refund through a WU money transfer or Western Union may issue the refund to the credit or debit card that was used to pay for the transaction. In lieu of receiving the refund by WU money transfer, You may request Western Union to mail You a check in the amount of the refund. Where required by law, refunds associated with certain international transfers may be eligible for different treatment.

							SPECIAL TERMS FOR INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS: Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to applicable law, international transfers may be canceled for a full refund of the principal and fees paid within 30 minutes of payment, unless the funds have been picked up or deposited.

The agreement with the Account Provider governs use of an Account and provides the rights and liabilities of the holder of an Account. Unless required by applicable law, Western Union accepts no responsibility to You or any Account holder for any fees imposed by an Account provider. If the currency You select for a transaction is not the currency in which an Account is denominated, the Account provider may convert the funds at its own currency exchange rate or reject the transfer. Account Services are for personal or individual use only and not for use by or on behalf of any business or legal entity.

							B. TRANSFERS TO ACCOUNTS: Receiver's agreement with the Account Provider governs Receiver's rights, liabilities and fees (including fees to transfer cash out of an Account), and the Account Provider may impose its own restrictions regarding funds availability, limits that may be transferred to or held in an Account, hours of operations, holidays or other limitations. In most cases, Receiver must be enrolled in the Account program to receive such a transfer. A Receiver who is not enrolled in the Account program may be able to receive funds at an Agent location and may be subject to additional requirements. Western Union may make money from fees associated with use of Accounts.

							C.

However, Western Union will not be liable where: (1) You do not have enough money available in Your Account; (2) Your Account is closed or withdrawals restricted; (3) the transaction exceeds dollar or frequency limitations imposed by Western Union or Your Account Provider; (4) circumstances beyond Western Union's control (such as flood, fire, power outages, mechanical or system failures); (5) Your Account Provider does not honor a transaction, the transaction is not processed or the transaction is returned by Your Account Provider; (6) Your instructions are lost or delayed in transmission to Western Union; (7) Western Union fails to process your transaction because of a reasonable security concern or the Service option has been discontinued or suspended, or Western Union otherwise advises You that Your request will not be processed; and (8) other exceptions allowed by law.
